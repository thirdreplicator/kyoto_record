A simple interface to Kyoto Cabinet, somewhat inspired by Active Record.
Programmed for ease of use and hopefully speed..... no benchmarks yet.

# Features
 * Just declare your attributes you want to persist.
 * Declare your indexes for a reverse lookup by value.
 * Range scan queries available.
 * Fast...?

Please fork.

require 'kyoto_record'

class Duck
  include KyotoRecord
  attr_kyoto :nickname, :waddle_power
  index_kyoto :nickname
end

donald = Duck.new
donald.nickname = "Don"
donald.waddle_power = false
donald.save

# Reboot your computer.
# Load back your data.

duck2 = Duck.find(1)
duck3 = Duck.find_by_nickname("Don")
